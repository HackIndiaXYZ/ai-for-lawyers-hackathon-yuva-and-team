This Agreement is made on [[to be filled: date]] at Hyderabad, Telangana, between ${v(d, "landlord_name", "landlord's full name and address")} (the **Landlord**) and ${v(d, "tenant_name", "tenant's full name and address")} (the **Tenant**).
## 1. Property and purpose
The Landlord lets to the Tenant the residential property at ${v(d, "property_address", "full property address")} (the **Premises**) for residential use only.
> why: A lease is defined by what it does, not what it is called, so the property and use must be clear. (Source: TPA-105)
## 2. Term
The tenancy begins on ${v(d, "start_date", "start date")} and runs for [[to be filled: term, for example 11 months]].
> why: A lease longer than one year must be registered, which is why many residential agreements run for 11 months. (Source: TPA-107, REG-17)
## 3. Rent
The Tenant shall pay rent of ${v(d, "monthly_rent", "monthly rent")} per month, on or before [[to be filled: due date]] of each month. Rent may be revised only by written agreement of both parties.
> why: A rent the landlord can change "as he sees fit" is too vague to enforce. (Source: ICA-29)
## 4. Security deposit
The Tenant has paid a refundable security deposit of ${v(d, "security_deposit", "security deposit")}. It shall be returned within [[to be filled: number of days]] days of the Tenant vacating, after deducting only proven unpaid dues or damage beyond normal wear and tear.
> why: A deposit cannot be forfeited beyond reasonable compensation, and a very high or non-refundable deposit signals an unfair term. (Source: ICA-74, MTA-2021)
## 5. Repairs and use
(a) The Tenant shall keep the Premises in good condition and shall not sublet without written consent.
(b) The Landlord shall disclose known defects and bear structural repairs. Ordinary wear and tear is not the Tenant's liability.
> why: The landlord has duties too, and charging a tenant for old damage can breach them. (Source: TPA-108)
## 6. Entry
The Landlord may enter the Premises on [[to be filled: hours of notice]] hours' prior notice at a reasonable time, or at once in an emergency.
> why: Entry at any time can be challenged as against privacy and public policy. (Source: CON-21)
## 7. Termination and notice
Either party may end the tenancy by giving [[to be filled: notice period]] days' written notice. If the Tenant leaves before the lock-in ends, compensation shall be limited to the Landlord's reasonable proven loss.
> why: A tenant cannot be told to leave immediately without notice, and a harsh early-exit sum can be cut down by a court. (Source: TPA-106, ICA-74)
## 8. Dispute resolution
Any dispute shall be referred to a sole arbitrator appointed by mutual consent, seated in Hyderabad, under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.
> why: Arbitration is allowed, but a clause letting one side appoint the arbitrator or decide finally is void. (Source: ARB-7, ARB-12, ICA-28)
## 9. Governing law and courts
This Agreement is governed by the laws of India, and the courts at Hyderabad, Telangana shall have jurisdiction.
> why: Courts must have real connection with the property, so a distant court alone may not work. (Source: CPC-16)
## 10. General
This is the entire agreement between the parties. If any clause is found invalid, the rest remains in force. Notices shall be in writing to the addresses above.
> why: Terms promised only by word of mouth are hard to enforce once the agreement is written. (Source: BSA-94)

- Pay stamp duty at Telangana's current rate and use stamp paper of the right value. Unstamped agreements cannot be relied on in court. (STAMP-35)

    `This Agreement runs from [[to be filled: start date]] until [[to be filled: end date or event]]. Either party may end it by giving [[to be filled: notice period]] days' written notice.`,
